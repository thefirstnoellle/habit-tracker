### Purpose

To create a habit tracker that allows you you keep track of your daily, weekly, and monthly habits with a user-friendly interface that's minimalistic and modern, and focuses on promoting and maintaining habits by letting users view their current, and longest, streak.

## :pencil: Motivation

My motivation for this project was that I wanted an all-in-one app where I could keep track of my habits, encourage me to maintain streaks, as well as let me record my thoughts or any notes I had about that day's progress because one thing I've learned about myself is that I'm more motivated to reach my goals if I have an easy way to track of my progress! This is my project for Get Coding Module 1 and is helping me learn to code.
